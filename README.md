# Chicago-Crime-Rate

Topic Description :
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2014 to 2017. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system.

Goal of the project :
The Goal of the project is to identify whether the rate of crimes in chicago is increasing or decreasing over the years and what type of crimes are been taking place the most eg. drugs/narcotics violation or sex offenses, etc. The goal is to see at which places are most of the crimes taking place for eg. apartments, office, roads etc and at what time of the day it takes place like whether majority of the incidents takes place at night or during day time. We can map the locations of the incidents to show heat maps for the highest or lowest no. of crimes taking place in the area.

Target Audience :
The target audience for this project is the local public of chicago who would be shifting from one area to another or the tourist who would be travelling to chicago for vaction or the international students who would come to chicago for the higher education and also to the chicago police department to see which ward has highest crimes so that they could increase their force in that area.

The first and most important part of the project was data cleaning on which I performed statistical algorithms. I cleaned the data by using Python's Pandas and Numpy library, After cleaning the data I performed visualization using matplot, seaborn and folium libraries followed by applying statistical models like Linear regression,KNN, Decision Trees, etc for prediction analysis. Through this models I got an accuracy of 90 %.
